-  Way to specify file types to mount #8 

Eg. I'd like to mount only music and document files, but I got stickers, photos and voice messages ;/

-  timeout raises IOError #10 

Could you add a way to retry on timeout and make retries amount configurable?
I can't use it right now as it breaks everything when telegram is lagging a bit.
